Title:
Deterministic Search for Goldbach Partitions in the Critical Region M/2: An Asymptotic and Algorithmic Approach

Abstract

The Goldbach conjecture, which states that every even integer M>2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes P and Q, 
has remained unresolved for nearly three centuries. 

This paper introduces a deterministic framework combining asymptotic analysis and efficient algorithms 
to demonstrate the existence of such primes P and Q in the critical interval IM = [M/2 -sqr(M),M/2+sqr(M)].

By leveraging the Prime Number Theorem (PNT) and parallelized primality testing, 
we show that the density of primes in IM grows asymptotically, 
ensuring the existence of Goldbach partitions for arbitrarily large M. 

Computational results confirm the algorithmâ€™s efficiency, identifying P and Q in milliseconds even for M= 10 to the 30th! 

While this work does not constitute a formal proof of the conjecture, it provides rigorous theoretical support 
for its validity in the asymptotic limit and establishes a foundation for future research.
